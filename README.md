ðŸ”’ Secure Your Data with a Simple Batch Script! ðŸ”’

As an IT enthusiast or cybersecurity professional, it's essential to know some handy tricks for securing sensitive information. Here's a batch script I created that enables basic folder locking in Windows. Perfect for quickly protecting personal files or sensitive data from prying eyes.

### Here's what the code does:
- **Locks a folder** named "Private" by hiding and converting it into a Control Panel shortcut.
- **Prompts for a password** to unlock, ensuring only those who know it can access the contents.
- Uses simple **commands like `attrib`, `ren`, and `set`** to manage folder visibility and access.

### How it Works:
1. **Folder Locking**: Transforms "Private" into an inaccessible, hidden system folder.
2. **Password Protection**: Ensures access to the folder with a password prompt.
3. **Custom Confirmation Prompts**: For those times when you just want to confirm your choice. 

This is a great start for beginners exploring batch scripting for Windows and can be an entry-level step toward understanding file access control!

Tip: Always back up important files, as this approach isnâ€™t foolproof against advanced bypass techniques.
